INDUSTRIAL AI COPILOT - PROJECT OVERVIEW & FEATURES
================================================================================

🎯 WHAT IS THE INDUSTRIAL AI COPILOT?

FOR NON-TECHNICAL AUDIENCE:
The Industrial AI Copilot is like having a smart assistant that knows everything 
about your factory's equipment, procedures, and safety manuals. Instead of 
searching through hundreds of paper documents or multiple computer systems, 
workers can simply ask questions in plain English and get instant, accurate 
answers with references to the exact source documents.

Think of it as "ChatGPT for factories" - but much safer and smarter because it 
only uses your company's approved documents and never shares sensitive 
information with outside systems.

FOR TECHNICAL AUDIENCE:
The Industrial AI Copilot is an enterprise-grade Retrieval-Augmented Generation 
(RAG) system specifically designed for industrial environments. It combines 
advanced NLP processing, vector databases, and LLM integration to provide 
contextual Q&A capabilities while maintaining strict data privacy through PII 
detection, hybrid embedding architecture, and comprehensive audit trails.

================================================================================
🏗️ SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE & TECHNICAL STRENGTH
================================================================================

HYBRID AI ARCHITECTURE (Technical Differentiator):
- Local + Cloud Processing: Sensitive content processed locally (384d embeddings), 
  general content uses cloud APIs (768d embeddings)
- Smart Routing: Automatic detection of sensitive vs. non-sensitive content
- No Data Leakage: Raw documents never sent to external APIs - only sanitized, 
  minimal context

ENTERPRISE-GRADE SECURITY:
- PII Protection: Microsoft Presidio integration for automatic detection and masking
- Role-Based Access Control: Admin, Editor, Viewer, Plant Manager, Technician roles
- JWT Authentication: Secure token-based sessions
- Audit Logging: Complete tracking of all interactions and document access

PRODUCTION-READY INFRASTRUCTURE:

🔒 SECURITY & DATA PROTECTION
================================================================================

HOW WE PREVENT DATA LEAKAGE (Without Private Servers):

1. SMART DATA MASKING:
- Automatic detection of sensitive information (employee IDs, machine serial 
  numbers, plant names)
- Real-time redaction before any external API calls
- Generic token replacement (MACHINE_01 instead of actual serial numbers)

2. HYBRID PROCESSING ARCHITECTURE:
- Sensitive content: Processed locally with sentence-transformers (never leaves 
  your system)
- General content: Uses cloud APIs only after sanitization
- Smart routing based on content sensitivity analysis

3. NO RAW DOCUMENT SHARING:
- LLM never sees complete documents or manuals
- Only receives 2-5 relevant, sanitized chunks per query
- No document storage or training on external systems

4. STATELESS LLM USAGE:
- No conversation memory in external systems
- No data retention beyond request lifecycle
- API modes that explicitly prevent training on your data

5. ANSWER VALIDATION:
- Response checking for accidental sensitive information leakage
- Source citation enforcement (no citation = no answer)
- Automatic blocking of responses containing restricted terms
